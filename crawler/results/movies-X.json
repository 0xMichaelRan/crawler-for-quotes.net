Ormus was born approximately 6,000 years ago. It began from the death of the man you worship as your Lord. Officially, it existed to convey the man's existence to coming generations. But its true purpose... was to manage the \"words\" he passed on. The program you call Lemegeton is, in fact, those words. It's a failsafe installed by God that can cause this universe to dissipate. Though it appears the man you call your Lord didn't know that. Of course that was to be expected, for those were the words of Yeshua. To protect the universe from dissipation, I created an organization to manage and watch over those words. That's Ormus's true objective. Not just the words, but also the artifacts of God, passed down from ancient times. All of them are beyond human control.Margulis: Are you saying our devout wish to return to Lost Jerusalem is all a lie?Wilhelm: Yes, exactly. You needed words, faith, to define who you are. What were you planning on doing once you returned to that place? It disappeared because it was fated to. Because of human action.Margulis: Then all we've done so far, all we've worked for was meaningless?Wilhelm: It wasn't meaningless as long as you, yourself, believe it wasn't meaningless. After all, that's why I've continued to exist. Now, what will you do, Margulis? You must make a decision that will define who you are. Will you leave this place, or...Margulis: I-I...Wilhelm: Yes.

That's probably what the ideal vision of being human is all about. However, we humans are really not that strong. And we know that we can't live like that. We're creatures that are much more flawed, weak and smaller than that. We hurt others, we lie to ourselves, we hate, we blame others, we regret, but, even if we are weak, and even if it is our fate to disappear entirely, I think the will to change the future is still an important one. We must try to change things around us, little by little. Even if it is one step at a time and even if everything is already pre-determined, it's not something for us to be sad about. No. On the contrary, the future is overflowing with hope. And we have infinite paths to choose from. Isn't that right? chaos?
